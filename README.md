## Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between social media usage and mental health, focusing on depression levels as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). By employing both quantitative and qualitative methods, we explore usage durations from 1 to 4 hours and their impact on mental health outcomes. Our findings indicate that shorter social media usage correlates with lower depressive symptoms, while longer usage is associated with higher BDI scores.

## Introduction
The rise of social media has raised concerns about its potential negative effects on mental health. This study examines how varying durations of social media engagement influence depression levels among users.

## Methodology
We employed a correlational research design involving a sample of 5 students. The independent variable is social media usage, and the dependent variable is the BDI depression score.

## Data Analysis
The correlation analysis showed a strong positive relationship (r = 0.99) between social media usage and BDI scores, indicating that increased usage is linked to higher depression levels.

## Conclusions
This research highlights the need for greater accountability from social media platforms regarding their impact on mental health, emphasizing the importance of promoting healthier usage practices.

## Limitations
The small sample size (n=5) limits generalizability, and the lack of a control group and cultural diversity may affect the findings.
